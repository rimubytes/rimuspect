I got really curious about how those fancy metrics and monitoring tools actually work under the hood. You know, the ones that make those cool dashboards and send you alerts when things go sideways? Yeah, those!

## What This Project Does

This DIY Metrics Tool does the following:

- Collects basic system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Stores the metrics in a time-series database (using SQLite for simplicity)
- Provides a simple API to query the metrics
- Generates basic graphs of the metrics
- Implements a rudimentary alerting system

### How to run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (check requirements.txt)
3. Run python `main.py`

#### What I learned

1. Building this tool taught me a ton:
2. The importance of efficient data storage for time-series data
3. The challenges of querying and aggregating large amounts of data quickly
4. The intricacies of building a reliable data collection system
5. The art of creating meaningful visualizations from raw data
6. The complexity of building a robust alerting system

#### What's next?

This project is far from complete. Some things I'd like to add or improve:

- Support for more types of metrics and data sources
- A proper web interface for viewing metrics and configuring alerts
- Better scalability for handling larger volumes of data
- More sophisticated alerting rules and notification methods
- Integration with popular notification services (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
